# the-calculators-of-python
A few calculators made with different Python parsing libraries.

These are the ones I used in this repo:
* [PLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply) | [plyCalc.py]()
* [SLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly) | [slyCalc.py]()
* [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) | [larkCalc.py]()

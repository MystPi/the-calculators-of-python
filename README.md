# the-calculators-of-python
A few calculators made with different Python parsing libraries.

These are the ones I used in this repo:
* [PLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply) | [plyCalc.py](src/plyCalc.py)
* [SLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/sly) | [slyCalc.py](src/slyCalc.py)
* [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) | [larkCalc.py](src/larkCalc.py)
